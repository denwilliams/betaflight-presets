#$ TITLE: 4.3 Filter settings for NORMAL toothpick build with RPM FILTERING for an F4 processor.
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: FILTERS
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: rpm, DShot telemetry, filter, filters, normal, toothpick
#$ AUTHOR: Den Williams
#$ DESCRIPTION: Intended for a well maintained build in good condition with RPM filtering.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Ensure that DShot Telemetry is working properly!
#$ DESCRIPTION: If motors get hot, try a filter set for noisy or very noisy motors.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If motors grind or make noise at idle, lower the D filter slider.
